## Who I Am

I'm 70 years old and Dutch. I spent 40 years in enterprise IT infrastructure:

- **Microsoft MVP** (Hyper-V)
- **Co-author**: *Microsoft Private Cloud Computing*
- **Technical Editor**: Multiple Hyper-V books
- **Blogger**: Hyper.nu (2009-2017)

Since 2017, I've lived in **Bangkok, Thailand**.

## What This Blog Covers

Europe faces two inseparable challenges:

### Digital Infrastructure Sovereignty

From processors to operating systems, from data centers to energy systems - Europe must control its own technological stack. Current dependence on US cloud providers and Chinese hardware creates strategic vulnerability.

### Defense & Security Sovereignty

European military autonomy is impossible while running on American infrastructure. You cannot defend your territory when your command systems, intelligence processing, and secure communications depend on others' clouds and processors.

### Economic Transformation

Both pillars require - and enable - massive economic opportunity: European tech jobs, strategic industries, reduced licensing costs, innovation ecosystems.

## Why I'm Writing

From Bangkok, I watch Europe debate military spending while missing the critical point: **you cannot buy defense sovereignty with money alone**. Spending €100B more on defense while buying American F-35s running American software on American processors just increases dependence.

Europe has the talent, the resources, and the democratic values to achieve independence. What's missing is coordinated action.

This blog examines what must be built, why current fragmented national efforts aren't enough, and how digital and defense sovereignty are inseparable.

## A Recent Example

My home country, the Netherlands, created **ASML** - the only company in the world that makes machines for advanced computer chips. Dutch technology. Dutch engineering. Global strategic importance.

But when the United States decided ASML couldn't sell to China, the **Dutch government complied** - losing billions in sales.

American control of Dutch technology.

That pattern - European technological excellence without European strategic autonomy - is what this blog addresses.
